        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Maria Lourdes T. Hontiveros a 1st year College student in Lapu-Lapu City College taking the course Bachelor of Industrial Technology major in Computer Technology with the grade and section 1-C.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu on August 26th of 2006. I am the youngest in my family. Most of my family and friends call me by my nickname "Diday". I love color Pink but my favorite color is Blue. I prefer being at home than going outside and I don't like being in a crowded places.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Education</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2018 - Mactan Elementary School</li>
            <li>2022 - Mactan National High School</li>
            <li>2024 - Mactan National High School</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Hobies</h2>
        <p>As I mentioned above that I prefer being at home I also like going into the beach or somewhere near in the sea, sitting and listening to the sounds of the waves. I love eating spicy foods and watching movies. Sometimes I play Mobile Online Games with friends. I love to sleep and to rest. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>This year, I'm focusing on balancing my new independence without burning out. I'll use a planner to break down study sessions for my toughest class so I don't cram last-minute. To stay healthy, I'll swap midnight ramen snacks for prepped veggies and hummus in the fridge. I'm saving 100 pesos a week from my School Allowance for a spring break trip with friends, but still budgeting for weekly allowance priorities. I'll join one club to meet people outside my major, even if it feels awkward at first. And lastly my final goal is to finish study, apply for work and get paid and help my parents and buy the things that I love and spoil my loved ones.</p>
